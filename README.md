# AE Engine

AE Engine is a game engine built on top of LibSDL and Lua.
Game logic is coded in Lua which is an
efficient scripting language and lets you write less and do more. SDL in turn
provides unified interface over various platforms.
AE Engine supports Android™ and iOS. Combining Lua and SDL gives possibility
to run the same code on different platforms.

## Simulator

The engine comes up with a simulator which runs natively on your desktop or
laptop. The simulator speeds up development as it runs directly from the
game code you’re currently working on. This approach saves the time necessary
to build a package, upload it to a real device and then run it.

## AE Studio

AE Engine provides an IDE called AE Studio which in general aims to boost
game development. It has a number of features:
- Lua editor with autocompletion and outline,
- Lua source navigation,
- on-the-fly compilation to have an opportunity to fix errors before running,
- fully functional debugger for the simulator,
- building packages for Android and iOS,
- uploading and running projects on Android devices.
